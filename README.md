# PARCS ET JARDINS DES BOUCHES-DU-RHÔNES

## Project made in pure Javascript, HTML/CSS and Mapbox

The first version of this project was made in 2016 when I started learning how to code and use an API to fetch remote data.

The API used shows data about parcs and gardens in the french departement of the Bouches-du-Rhônes (13), in the Provence-Alpes-Côtes-d'Azur region. To enhace the display of coordinates of a localisation, the different places are displayed on a map.

Unlike the first version of this project, we are now able to :

- display all the parcs on the map when loading the page
- filter the parcs through the list of all the available cities
- display and focus on a single marker of the map when clicking on a parc name of the list.
